                            <h6>Absolutely not. We follow very strict privacy guidelines. The information about
                                individual donors is
                                only saved to be shared with the hospitals. This hospitals are verified by us and only
                                verfied hospitals can access donor data. The communication between the hospital and the
                                individual donor is supposed to take place directly.

                                come in
                                contact with hospitals which are looking for them.

                                donors which are in the vicinity of the hospitals are verified by the hospitals
                                themselves.
                                Only verified hospitals can view donor details.

                            <h6>No, it is absolutely up to the individual. If you are a recovered patient of COVID-19
                                then it is
                                your choice to become a donor of your plasma and antibodies.
                                Since Government’s and Doctors across the world have not been able to come up with a
                                vaccine for
                                COVID-19 hence this becomes the only way in which critical patients can be helped.</h6>

                            <h6>COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they
                                are eligible
                                to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a
                                laboratory
                                test and meet other laboratory criteria. Individuals must have fully recovered from
                                COVID-19, with
                                complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before donation of convalescent

                            <h6>Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is
                                no approved
                                treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests this method might
                                help some
                                patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is currently undergoing, to
                                determine if
                                convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of the illness, reduce morbidity, or
                                prevent death

                                you which are
                                collecting plasma for COVID-19 treatment will contact you. Once you agree to become a

                                plasma, these hospitals will take your plasma, separate out the antibodies and these
                                antibodies will
                                be sent to another/same hospital where patients are being treated and isolated.</h6>

                            <h6>No, this is a myth. Since there is blood transfusion that happens during plasma
                                therapy,
                                but only

                            <h6>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who
                                have
                                recovered
                                from an infection. Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might
                                help fight the
                                infection.</h6>
