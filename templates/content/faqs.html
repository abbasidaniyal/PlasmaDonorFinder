                            <h6>Absolutely not. We follow very strict privacy guidelines. The information about individual donors is
                                only saved to be shared with the hospitals. After which, the communication is supposed to happen

                            <h6>This website is not made to do plasma therapy. This is just a platform where donors can come in
                                contact with hospitals which are looking for them.
                                On this website, once a Donor registers and completes their profile. The reports uploaded by the
                                donors are checked by the hospitals that fall under the same pincode as the donors.
                                The geographical category being used in the website is PINCODE. So please make sure you put in your

                            <h6>No, it is absolutely up to the individual. If you are a recovered patient of COVID-19 then it is
                                your choice to become a donor of your plasma and antibodies.
                                Since Government’s and Doctors across the world have not been able to come up with a vaccine for
                                COVID-19 hence this becomes the only way in which critical patients can be helped.</h6>

                            <h6>No, this is a myth. Since there is blood transfusion that happens during plasma therapy, but only
                                plasma transfusion hence the red and white blood cells don’t need to have the same blood group.</h6>

                                Plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by most patients, but can cause allergic
                                reactions and other side effects. It is also not known if patients with COVID-19 might have other
                                types of reactions to convalescent plasma.
                                While it is not known if convalescent plasma is safe and effective against COVID-19, there is
                                anecdotal evidence that convalescent plasma might be for some patients.
                                Because there are no approved treatments, the ICMR is permitting the limited investigational use of
                                convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 under the criteria of the emergency IND.</h6>

                                from an infection. Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might help fight the
